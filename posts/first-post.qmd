My initial blog post is about what I'm hoping to get out of MicroPs. I am excited by the possibilities of what I can accomplish by learning how to create embedded systems. I am looking forward to learning how to influence the physical world from the digital domain. I have heard of many cool MicroPs final projects throughout my time at Mudd, and I can't wait to work on a project of my own! I am really hoping to keep an efficient work schedule so I can learn everything this course has to offer, and effectively apply this learning to my clinic project working on a robotic system for XDemics' bioreactor.
