This semester I am taking Microprocessor-based systems, and I will be documenting my work on this page. I am also working on a robotic system for XDemics Corporation’s bioreactors through Mudd’s clinic program. I find digital electronics and robotics exciting, and I look forward to sharing my work here.\nOutside of my schoolwork, my hobbies include skiing, lifting, listening to music, and messing with old audio equipment.\nI also love my bird"

    "text": "My initial blog post is about what I’m hoping to get out of MicroPs. I am excited by the possibilities of what I can accomplish by learning how to create embedded systems. I am looking forward to learning how to influence the physical world from the digital domain. I have heard of many cool MicroPs final projects throughout my time at Mudd, and I can’t wait to work on a project of my own! I am really hoping to keep an efficient work schedule so I can learn everything this course has to offer, and effectively apply this learning to my clinic project working on a robotic system for XDemics’ bioreactor."
