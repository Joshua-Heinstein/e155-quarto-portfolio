A clock divider was created in the top module.\nThe LEDs soldered onto the board were used. LED2 was the oscillating one, while LED0 and LED1 were toggled using combinational logic where LED0 = s0^s1, and LED1 = s2&s3.\nThe 7 segment display was placed on a breadboard with a 3.3V source,1kΩ current limiting resistors leading to ground at the FPGA pins. Combinational logic was used to translate the binary from the switches to specific combinations of LED segments that would display 0-f."

VERI-1063 [ai.sv:16]\nGPT said to use this code:\n\nIt kept generating the same error codes.\nChatGPT was clearly unable to realize it did the exact same thing that was causing the problem in the first attempt. This makes it frustrating to use LLMs for this type of work because you can tell it exactly what is wrong and it will keep doing the same wrong thing. The quality of this output is quite low because it didn’t work and didn’t get any better. I was not familiar with the way it wanted to instantiate the clock. The LLM generated code did not synthesize because the core way it is trying to generate the clock is not working. Next time, I might think about using the LLM to find a specific issue I have rather than starting from scratch and having it generate me a completely wrong thing."

I am looking forward to learning how to influence the physical world from the digital domain. I have heard of many cool MicroPs final projects throughout my time at Mudd, and I can’t wait to work on a project of my own! I am really hoping to keep an efficient work schedule so I can learn everything this course has to offer, and effectively apply this learning to my clinic project working on a robotic system for XDemics’ bioreactor."
