I'm Joshua Heinstein and I am a senior studying Electrical Engineering at Harvey Mudd College. This semester I am taking Microprocessor-based systems, and I will be documenting my work on this page. I am also working on a robotic system for XDemics Corporation's bioreactors through Mudd's clinic program. I find digital electronics and robotics exciting, and I look forward to sharing my work here. 

Outside of my schoolwork, my hobbies include skiing, lifting, listening to music, and messing with old audio equipment. 



I also love my bird
